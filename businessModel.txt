PROBLEM:
Casinos suffer damage to their reputation from the bad press around their 'immoral' excercise. They are seen as organizations that suck money from the common people into the hands of the rich.

PROBLEM OWNER:
The Casino Industry, and the over $340 Billion in revenue that the top ten countries for gambling alone bring in annually.

SOLUTION:
What if we could benefit this image while doing genuine social good?
We Can.
We can now share profits with charities of consumers' choice, doing social good and giving people a positive reason to gamble.
